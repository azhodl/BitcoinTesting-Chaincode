Attached are: 

STEPS.md which outlines my process in the application. Please review my candid comments to ensure I am a fit for this program.

my_example_test.py is my modified program which mines 12 blocks via changes within run_test() method under ExampleTest() class.

The debug logs from each node confirm an additional block was mined and recieved by the network.

test_framework.log also supports this.

Finally, CONSOLE.md is included to show how I used a counter and print statement within the loop for immediate verification.
